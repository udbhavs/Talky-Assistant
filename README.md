# Talky-Assistant
A voice asssitant in development. There might be problems in speech recognition if certain permissions are denied by browsers such as Chrome. To talk to Talky by typing, type something in the input box and press the green ball. To speak to Talky (if permissions allow or you run the code yourself), leave the input box <b>empty</b> and press the ball. Speech recognition will begin. <br>
You can type something like <b>Hi, Talky!</b><br>
Talky will most likely respond by asking for a username. You can ignore him or set username by this command:<br>
  <b>set username to Udbhav</b><br>
  Actually, using the <b>set</b> command you can set anything you want, and retrieve it later in the same session. For example, you can try:<br>
  <b>set food to pizza</b><br>
  Now, to <b>retrieve</b> the value of food, just type:<br>
  <b>retrieve food</b><br>
  You can also ask Talky questions:<br>
  <b>Who was the first president of Russia?</b><br>
  Talky will respond by searching the web.<br>
  To make Talky say something, use the <b>say</b> command:<br>
  <b>say hello udbhav!</b><br>
  Talky is in development.<br>
